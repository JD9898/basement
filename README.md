# basement

Hi, 

Welcome to my personal website project basement. This is a React + Spring boot application and a space where I am constantly updating new features on.
So far, it has included features and contents such as theme selector, investment strategies, trading diary and reflection sections. 
It was first built to be my portfolio and to record my investment trajectory as I grow. But in the future, I intended to build a social network
on top of that. So users can come in and comment on their own views in markets and trading, sort of like reddit. I am still exploring the
potential of this project and will be happy to take any suggestions and feedback. If you have any of these, feel free to drop me an email at:
jademinwei.wang@gmail.com :)

A demo video of the current develop branch can be found with the link below:

P.S. I have attached a google drive link for now on some interesting trades I made since I started this August, some strategies and reflection, etc:

Hope you enjoy:)
